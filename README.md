The files ending with `T` are text dumps of the program source code that can
be loaded with `*EXEC`.  They are provided to enable differences to be tracked
more easily by git (as opposed to the tokenised code without the `T`).

Versions included are:

* Acorn BBC BASIC 2 (as supplied with the BBC Micro) inc. crunched versions
* 6502 using BBC BASIC assembler
* Z80 using Richard Russell's Z80 BBC BASIC assembler
* ARM using the Acorn ARM BBC BASIC assembler (on PiTubeDirect)
* RV using the RISC-V BBC BASIC assembler (on PiTubeDirect)
